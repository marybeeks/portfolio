<p>Creative hotlist is a subsidiary company to Communication Arts. Communication Arts, founded in 1959, is one of the
  largest creative magazines in the world and was the first major publication to launch a web presence in 1995. Part of
  the initial launch was a career section that included listings of jobs available and wanted ads. This section quickly
  became a premiere career resource for the professional creative marketplace and was relaunched as Creative Hotlist in
  2001.</p>

</div>

<p>Since 2001 Creative Hotlist has not updated the site. The current site is clunky, crowded and outdated. Since then
  they have lost their frontrunner position in this industry. Today creative hotlist gets about 245,000 monthly visits
  but only has 56 active job listings. My team and I redesigned their website to be responsive, have more intuitive
  navigation, and to look more modern.</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h1>Discover</h1>
</div>

<p>The goal of our research was to find out what was important to users when searching for a job.
  We also wanted to find out what they felt was difficult or lacking on other competitors sites.</p>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

<p>We analyzed some of the top competitors in the job search market which was indeed, linkedin, 
and glassdoor.</p>

<h2>User Interviews</h2>

<p>While we were not able to find any users of creative hotlist, we were able to find users that were currently looking for
  jobs to get insights from. The following is an example of a few questions I wrote for our interviews:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What devices do you usually use to search and apply for jobs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could be better about how you do this?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which tool do you like to use the best?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These questions gave us some of our most useful insights. We found that most users were searching for jobs on mobile and
  saving them. Later, they would do applications when they had time to sit in front of a computer or laptop. We also
  learned that most people felt that their applications were lost in a sea of applicants and that their application wasn’t
  going to stand out. As far as what tools they used to search for jobs most people liked different channels for different
  reasons. For example, some users mentioned they like Indeed because it offers a wider selection of jobs, but others like
  Linkedin because they feel it’s more professional.</p>

<p>From here we were able to take all our findings and do some affinity mapping to help us see strong trends and focus in
  on what’s important.</p>

  <h1>Define</h1>
</div>

<h2>Persona</h2>

<p>All this research is what brought us to our persona, Jenna, a young graphic designer who is looking for a career change.</p>

<div class="centered">
  <img src="/assets/images/persona.phg.png" class='full-width'>
</div>

<p>Since Jenna first attempted to use the site she has not had a very positive experience. The site is clunky on her laptop
and unuseable on her phone.</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h1>Develop</h1>
</div>

<p>Based on Jenna’s needs and pain points we identified our problem and hypothesis statement.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Jenna comes across several challenges when using Creative Hotlist to look for jobs. She needs a way to browse and save
jobs on the go. She also needs to be able to apply for jobs in a way that is both quick and thorough.</p>

<h2>Hypothesis</h2>

<p>We believe that by making a modern, responsive website for Jenna. We will achieve a better user experience. We will know
this to be true when we see a 10% increase of monthly visitors to the site.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>We began by doing a design studio and rapidly sketching out wireframes. This way we could narrow down our visual scope
and agree on the layout.</p>

</div>

<h2>User Flow</h2>

<p>On the user flow we focused on the basics of what Jenna would need to do to update her profile, search and save jobs on
the go and then apply for them on her laptop.</p>

<div class="centered">

</div>

<h2>Usability Testing</h2>

<p>Our usability testing followed the typical journey Jenna would take to apply for a job, starting from mobile and ending
on desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks we gave our users:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Search for graphic design jobs (on mobile) in Austin, TX and save most recent postings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On desktop update your profile and portfolio.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Search for graphic design jobs (on desktop) in Austin, TX.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to saved jobs section and apply for a job.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Main problems our users experienced:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thought the pop-ups were way too big.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were confused by the “request recommendation” section on the profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wasn’t sure how to edit profile or portfolio once information was input.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What we did to solve those problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reduced the size of the pop-ups to fit the screen better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We decided to eliminate the “request recommendation” feature altogether. After meeting with our stakeholders we
    realized that was leaning too much like the social media function on Linkedin and they were looking to be purely a job
    board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added a dot menu on those pages containing an edit button.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="centered">
  <h1>Deliver</h1>
</div>

<p>After user testing we iterated ad created hi-fi mock-ups and user tested again, this time with more success.</p>

<p>While our goal was to create a responsive site where users could easily display works on their portfolio, we wanted the
visual design to look more modern to reflect it’s update.</p>

<div class="grid space-evenly auto-fit-250 gap-20">
  <img src="/assets/images/page_1.png" class="full-width">
  <img src="/assets/images/page_2.png" class="full-width">
  <img src="/assets/images/page_3.png" class="full-width">
</div>

<p>At the end of this project I felt that we solved Jenna’s problem and addressed her needs. But as this was only a 2-week
spring there were more things we’d have liked to do had time allowed.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create and test for an employer looking to hire candidates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flesh out and polish the UI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introduce a dar version of the site.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
